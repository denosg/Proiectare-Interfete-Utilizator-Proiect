      <h2>The origins of alphabet</h2>
      <p>
         Robert Bringhurst wrote that writing is the solid form of language, the precipitate. But writing is also much more than that, and its origins, its evolution, and the way it is now woven into the fabric of civilizations makes it a truly wonderful story. That story spans some 5,000 years. We'll travel vast distances, meet an emperor, a clever Yorkshire-man, a Phoenician princess by the name of Jezebel, and the 'purple people'; we'll march across deserts and fertile plains, and sail across oceans. We will begin where civilization began, meander through the Middle Ages, race through the Renaissance, and in doing so discover where our alphabet originated, how and why it evolved, and why, for example, an A looks, well, like an A.
